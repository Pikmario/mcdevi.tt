        <p>We're having a very small, intimate wedding and, naturally, we're trying to do it on a budget.</p>
        <p>For a few odds and ends, we were wondering if we could borrow certain things for the party to make our day perfect, or if anybody had any idea where to purchase things cheaply.</p>
        <p>We appreciate any help, but please don't feel obligated (that goes for gifts too). We will whatever we need closer to the date. You guys are our closest family and friends and your presence in and of itself means the world to us!</p>
